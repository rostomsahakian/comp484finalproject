        Every minute of a childâ€™s time at school is important. Children who are absent for even one day, or who
        arrive later than their classmates, miss valuable instruction time and can easily fall behind in school.
        They also miss important socialization time and fun with their peers.

       In the state of California, school attendance is mandatory for all students ages six through eighteen.
        California State Law says that a child is absent if he/she is ill or if there is a death in the immediate
        family (1-3 day limit). All other absences are unexcused. Any tardy over 30 minutes, except for
        medical reasons, is also unexcused. If your child has three unexcused absences or tardies, he/she will be
        considered truant (policy on truancy, visit the Student Services Department webpage). Students who
        continue to have excessive absences, tardies, or truancies will be referred to the District School
        Attendance Review Board.

        In order to provide the best education possible for school age children, it is imperative that students have
        regular attendance. This will not only help children gain the most their school experience, but it will also
        help the school district financially. There is a financial impact on district revenues from the state every
        day a student is absent. When a student is absent from school it results in a loss of funding for our
        district. The State of California does not reimburse school districts for days students
